# Python - More Classes and Objects
- Write an empty class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle:
- Write a class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle by: (based on `0-rectangle.py`)
- Write a class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle by: (based on `1-rectangle.py`)
- Write a class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle by: (based on `2-rectangle.py`)
- Write a class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle by: (based on `3-rectangle.py`)
- Write a class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle by: (based on `4-rectangle.py`)
- Write a class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle by: (based on `5-rectangle.py`)
- Write a class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle by: (based on `6-rectangle.py`)
- Write a class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle by: (based on `7-rectangle.py`)
- Write a class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle by: (based on `8-rectangle.py`)
- The N queens puzzle is the challenge of placing N non-attacking queens on an N×N chessboard. Write a program that solves the N queens problem.

    * Usage: nqueens N
        * If the user called the program with the wrong number of arguments, print Usage: nqueens N, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 1
    * where N must be an integer greater or equal to 4
        * If N is not an integer, print N must be a number, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 1
        * If N is smaller than 4, print N must be at least 4, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 1
    * The program should print every possible solution to the problem
        * One solution per line
        * Format: see example
        * You don’t have to print the solutions in a specific order
    * You are only allowed to import the sys module
